****************Bank Collect Task Project******************
Using this project template is pretty simple.
Just copy the Zipped File BankCollect Task Template to [root directory]\...\Documents\Visual Studio 2015 [or installed version]\My Exported Templates
and you'll be up and running.

It comes with the Dependent dlls
Parkway.Tools.Nhibernate
Nhibernate
Quartz
Parkway.Scheduler


If you build and it fails, Fix it yourself and let me know how you fixed it.

Cheers
